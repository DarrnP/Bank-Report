# Bank-Report
Bored of the regular Kaggle datasets, I decided to prompt ChatGPT to create a custom dataset for a bank , consisting of the following customer details:

🔸 Customer ID
🔸 Account Type
🔸 Transaction Card Type
🔸 City ID

Using SQL to extract and transform the data, and Excel to build the dashboard, I analyzed the customer demographics such as age, income, account types, and transaction types. 🛠️📈

Key Findings :
🔹 64% of account holders in this bank are adults with mid-tier incomes.
🔹 Most of the loans applied for were personal loans.
🔹 66% of the bank’s transactions are conducted using debit cards.

Recommendations :
1️⃣ Target and market to young adults (ages 18-22) by providing attractive interest rates, cashback rewards, or career development opportunities, as there are very few customers from that category.
2️⃣ Promote credit card transactions by offering enticing incentives like discounts on flights, hotels, or movie bookings.
